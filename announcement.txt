Let's get together for another exciting talk and discussion about programming
language theory!  This event will focus on type theory; the fundamentals of the
theory, its basis within programming language type systems, its importance in
functional programming, and its relevance to us as Clojure programmers.

The talk will be given by Clojure programmer and aspiring type theory
aficionado, Bruce Miller.  Bring your brains (and your appetites) for what is
sure to be a worldview-expanding, eyebrow-raising, and intellect-flexing
evening of computer science camaraderie.
